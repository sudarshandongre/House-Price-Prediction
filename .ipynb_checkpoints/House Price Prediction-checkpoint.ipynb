      "                                Ghatkopar West is a prominent residential locality in the eastern suburbs placed along the Central Line of the Mumbai Suburban network. The locality is dominated by multi- storey apartments. Residential demand in this area is driven by proximity to various employment centres, along with sound connectivity to other areas. It is located in vicinity to major residential and commercial locations of eastern Mumbai such as Kurla, Vikhroli, and Powai. Many completed, as well as under-construction high-rise residential projects are Wadhwa The Address, Kalpataru Aura, Runwal Orchard Residency, Anchor Residency, and Sanghavi One.Connectivity to major areas of central and southern Mumbai, and Thane is excellent through the central line, LBS Marg, and the Eastern Express Highway. Further, the Eastern Express Highway, along with easy access to Kurla station (harbour line) provide connectivity to Navi Mumbai. The metro and Andheri-Kurla Road connect to Airport, and western suburbs. The under-construction Metro Line 4 (Wadala-Ghatkopar-Mulund-Kasarvadavali) which is expected by the end of 2022 would enhance connectivity to Mumbai and Thane. Moreover, Mumbai International Airport is located within 5-7 km from Ghatkopar West.\n",

The locality is dominated by multi- storey apartments. Residential demand in this area is driven by proximity to various employment centres, along with sound connectivity to other areas. It is located in vicinity to major residential and commercial locations of eastern Mumbai such as Kurla, Vikhroli, and Powai. Many completed, as well as under-construction high-rise residential projects are Wadhwa The Address, Kalpataru Aura, Runwal Orchard Residency, Anchor Residency, and Sanghavi One.Connectivity to major areas of central and southern Mumbai, and Thane is excellent through the central line, LBS Marg, and the Eastern Express Highway. Further, the Eastern Express Highway, along with easy access to Kurla station (harbour line) provide connectivity to Navi Mumbai. The metro and Andheri-Kurla Road connect to Airport, and western suburbs. The under-construction Metro Line 4 (Wadala-Ghatkopar-Mulund-Kasarvadavali) which is expected by the end of 2022 would enhance connectivity to Mumbai and Thane. Moreover, Mumbai International Airport is located within 5-7 km from Ghatkopar West.\n",
